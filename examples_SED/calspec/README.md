## Purpose

- Show how to read calspec spectra, how to get them in photon units, how to renormalise them, how to compute magnitudes in the bands...


### 1_MakeCalspecList.ipynb		

- read all calspec in their pytynphot directory and produce an astropy table. 

### 1bis_MakeHDCalspecList.ipynb	

- read all HD type calspec in their pytynphot directory and produce an astropy table. 

### 2_ViewCalspecSpectra.ipynb	

- from the astropy table generated by either **1\_MakeCalspecList.ipynb** or **1bis\_MakeHDCalspecList.ipynb**	 show view of the SED

### 3_ViewCalspecColors.ipynb

- From the astropy table generated by either **1\_MakeCalspecList.ipynb** or **1bis\_MakeHDCalspecList.ipynb**	 show how to renormalise at magnitude 10 the SED


### 4_ViewCalspecObsFlux.ipynb
- From the astropy table generated by either **1\_MakeCalspecList.ipynb** or **1bis\_MakeHDCalspecList.ipynb**	 show how to multiply by the instrument throughput to get a spectrum

This is very important to see how observable spectrum is obtained by multiplication of transmission of
hologram, CCD eff, **including second order transmission**.



### 5_SelectFiewColors.ipynb
- Select a fiew CALSPEC with various colors for color studies.
